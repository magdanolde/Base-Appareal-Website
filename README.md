Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

### :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

This is one of the front-end coding challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenges help to improve coding skills by building realistic projects. The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


### :unlock: FEATURES 

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
 
 ###  SOLUTIONS APPLIED IN THE PROJECT
 
* SASS - I was looking for a project, where I can learn and practice this pre-processor. That was my main goal. Hence, I tried to apply as many new features as possible:
    @mixin (also for media queries)
    @include
    @import
    map-get
    if statements 
* RWD
* JS - form validation/event listeners
